# PUIS Mock-up: PHP and MySQL Web Application

## Project Overview

This project is a mock-up of the President University Information System (PUIS) using PHP and MySQL. The goal is to demonstrate the implementation of CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations in a web application that emulates some functionalities of PUIS.

## Project Goals

1. Create a web application that mimics the look of PUIS.
2. Implement user authentication and authorization.
3. Develop CRUD functionality for managing subjects and schedules.
4. Demonstrate the integration of PHP with MySQL for database operations.

## Features

- User authentication (login system)
- Role-based access control
- CRUD operations for subjects
- CRUD operations for schedules
- Basic GUI resembling PUIS

## Database Structure

The application uses three main tables:

1. **users**: Stores login details and user privileges
2. **subjects**: Contains information about subjects, including name and lecturer ID
3. **schedule**: Holds data about when and where subjects are held
